# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ryan and I am a Principal Software Quality Engineer at Red Hat.

A little bit about myself:
* I have a bachelors degree in Computer Science
* I have over 8 years of experience in the software industry (most spent in Quality Engineering (automation/testing/building tools))
* I have a strong background in automation
* I am a strong debugger
* I am passionate for quality engineering and software development

I am part of the Multi Product Quality Engineering (Integration QE) team. Where we focus on testing the integration requirements between the products and the platforms they run on (e.g. OpenShift Container Platform). I am the technical lead for the team. Where I am responsible for being an architect and overseeing all projects. I focus on designing and building efficient continuous integration (CI) workflows for orchestrating the integration testing between the products.

I am very passionate for anything automation related. I am always looking to learn new skills to advance my automation skill set.

Part of my daily routine consists of:
* Programming in Python
* Automating tasks in Ansible
* Writing Groovy Jenkins pipelines/libraries
* Working in Linux environments
* Reviewing code reviews

ðŸŒ± I am currently working on expanding my programming knowledge to learn more about Go.

âš¡ Fun facts about me: When I am not working with technology, I enjoy:
* Spending time with my family
* Hanging out with my cat
* Auto (car) detailing
* Outdoor activities (biking, hiking, running)
