# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ryan and I am a Principal Software Quality Engineer at Red Hat.

A little bit about myself:
* Bachelors degree in Computer Science
* Over 7+ years of experience in the software industry
* Strong background in automation
* Strong debugger
* Passitonate for quality engineering and software development (designing and building applications).

I am currently a technical lead for my team and I am focused on designing and building efficent continuous integration (CI) workflows
for testing the integration points within multi product solutions. In parallel to that, I am invovlved with building software
applications/tools used as part of the CI workflows to test the multi product solutions.

I am very passontiate for anything automation related. I am always looking to learn new skills to advance my automation skill set.

On a daily basis I am programming in Python, automating tasks using Ansible, writing Groovy Jenkins pipelines/libraries and working
in Linux environments.
